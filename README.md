# Muslim Prayer Timer Application  

A simple yet effective C# application built using the .NET Framework to help users keep track of the five daily prayers in Islam. The app provides timely notifications with a bell sound when it's time for the next prayer.  

## Features  
- **Automatic Prayer Time Calculation**: Updates prayer times based on the current time.  
- **Notification Alerts**: Plays a bell sound when it's time for prayer.  
- **Simple & User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with a clean design.  
- **Five Daily Prayers**: Tracks **Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha** prayer times.  
 
## How It Works  
1. The application checks the current system time.  
2. Compares it with predefined prayer times (or calculates them based on location if implemented).  
3. Triggers a notification with a bell sound when a prayer time is reached.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.  
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio**.  
3. Build and run the application.  

## Requirements  
- .NET Framework v4.8 uper

## Future Enhancements
